How to make a Linked List Jam Session

In this program I made a jam session using a linked list. I started with a basic node class and set the next node to nil so that we do not have
to specifically define a tail. Then in my linked list class, I bulit in the functionality. I included an append method, as well as, a prepend
method so that I can add data to the head or the end. Then I created an insert method so that we could modify the data along any point of list.
In my beat box class, I added the functionality to not only play the beats that we created but we can also change the rate and the voice used.
